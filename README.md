# SIGNS-Recognition-Using-Tensorflow
One afternoon, with some friends we decided to teach our computers to decipher sign language. We spent a few hours taking pictures in front of a white wall and came up with the  dataset. And build an algorithm that would facilitate communications from a speech-impaired person to someone who doesn't understand sign language.
